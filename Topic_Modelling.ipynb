I sent them a letter describing exactly this issue and instead of not contacting me and verifying my debt they start reporting this debt to the credit reporting agencies. They never verified the debt, like I asked and they never stopped it from being reported when I specifically told them not to, due to the circumstances above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ...
