They never verified the debt, like I asked and they never stopped it from being reported when I specifically told them not to, due to the circumstances above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ...

              "      <td>When we were looking to start using credit cards to help build our credit we contacted USAA to see what options they had. The rep we spoke with told us our best option was their secured credit card. The benefit was after 2 years of payments we would be moved to an unsecured card and our deposit would be returned to us. We chose to do this since we really wanted to build credit. We had to call today to say we didn't want our deposit to roll into a CD and we wanted to withdraw it and to ask how the procedure was moving forward. ( Did we need new cards or anything else that we needed to do since our 2 years was up. ) The woman on the phone said we don't do secured cards anymore so you'll have to reapply ( dinging our credit again ) if we chose to withdraw our money. I asked her if she was really telling me that after we had done everything that was asked of us USAA was not going to follow thru on end of our contract. She put us on hold for quite awhile while she spoke with another department and came back. She had no explanation except that we had to reapply. I again asked the same question and she started beating around the bush so I stopped her and said it's a yes or no question and she no they would not be honoring the terms of the agreement. I advised that it would be in her best interest to get me a supervisor. Guess what, no supervisors were available and no one in ERT ( whatever that is ) was available either. She said she was putting in for an emergency call back from a supervisor. I said they will call today, correct? The CD will renew tomorrow and the decision has to be made today. She said she making it urgent. I again said they will call today correct. She said I am hanging up to get someone right now. It is now 2 hours later and no phone call and they are closed. No call. Not surprised. USAA has gone downhill since their new CEO has taken over. We are XXXX XXXX XXXX and can not go thru having our credit dinged more than it already is getting dinged right now by the federal government and banks to help out in the shut down. We chose USAA because of the program that they described to us and we did what was asked of us. They should be following thru and doing their part now that the 2 years are up. We have seen them break federal and state laws when it comes to insurance and have moved our insurance from them and now we see they think they are above the law in banking also. We hope that you will help us to let them know they are not.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I hired a contractor to install an epoxy floor in my basement. On XX/XX/XXXX, ( after being paid in full ) the contractor refused to finish the floor, honor the warranty, or provide compensation for the damages he caused to my bathtub and concrete patio. The payment to the merchant was split up into two separate transactions, so I disputed both charges with Citi on the same date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). My dispute numbers are XXXX and XXXX. Citi handled these disputes completely differently, and this dispute is regarding the way in which Citi has handled dispute # XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that they received the dispute XXXX, this email made no requests for information or even a detailed reason for my dispute. The next email I received came on XX/XX/XXXX. It said that they contacted the merchant and would let me know if they needed anything further. This is in stark contrast to the notice that was sent to my account on XX/XX/XXXX for the other dispute ( XXXX ) which requested a detailed account of the transaction as well as the reason for the dispute and documentation from an expert concerning what was wrong with the floor. I reached out to Citis dispute department via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I expressed my concern that I hadnt been asked to provide any information for the dispute in this complaint # XXXX. I was told that I could send the information via email and that it would be attached to my dispute. I sent all of the information that was requested for the other dispute in for the dispute in this complaint # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This information included statements from 4 different experts regarding the issues with the floor, a transcript of all the text communication between myself and the merchant ( including the text where he stated that he would not be honoring the warranty ), all email communication, the contract, warranty, terms and conditions, photos of the issues with the floor, and a detailed account of the reason for my dispute. All the information that I sent was the same that was sent for the other dispute, however on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my account stating that the investigation for the dispute in this complaint ( XXXX ) had been closed based on the information they had available. The notice stated that if I wanted to continue the dispute that I would need to return the signed letter as well as a review from a similar merchant saying what was done incorrectly and proof of what was expected vs. what was received. I contacted Citi dispute customer service again via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. The agent looked into the account and verified that all the required documentation was there. He told me that he would be making a note on my account so that the investigator would look back and find the information. He instructed me to send in the signed letter via email and write a note explaining that the information had already been sent. I called back in and spoke with another agent to verify that this was all that was needed, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in the signed letter with notations as instructed. I contacted Citi dispute center again on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure the letter was received and to verify that nothing further was needed and was told that everything was as it should be. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my account stating that my dispute had been reviewed and that they would not be able to assist because they did not have a letter from a similar merchant stating that the work performed by the original merchant was incorrectly or unnecessarily performed. I provided statements from 4 different similar merchants stating what was wrong with the floor and why it needed to be redone. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice in my account for the other dispute ( XXXX ) stating that they were continuing to try to obtain a permanent credit. Both disputes are for the same service and I have provided all of the same information. I do not believe the dispute in this complaint ( XXXX ) is being handled correctly. I have provided all the necessary and requested information in a timely fashion. The investigation into this dispute should have never been closed. The dispute # is XXXX</td>\n",

Systems have yet to make any attempt to update this amount.

              "56440  When we were looking to start using credit cards to help build our credit we contacted USAA to see what options they had. The rep we spoke with told us our best option was their secured credit card. The benefit was after 2 years of payments we would be moved to an unsecured card and our deposit would be returned to us. We chose to do this since we really wanted to build credit. We had to call today to say we didn't want our deposit to roll into a CD and we wanted to withdraw it and to ask how the procedure was moving forward. ( Did we need new cards or anything else that we needed to do since our 2 years was up. ) The woman on the phone said we don't do secured cards anymore so you'll have to reapply ( dinging our credit again ) if we chose to withdraw our money. I asked her if she was really telling me that after we had done everything that was asked of us USAA was not going to follow thru on end of our contract. She put us on hold for quite awhile while she spoke with another department and came back. She had no explanation except that we had to reapply. I again asked the same question and she started beating around the bush so I stopped her and said it's a yes or no question and she no they would not be honoring the terms of the agreement. I advised that it would be in her best interest to get me a supervisor. Guess what, no supervisors were available and no one in ERT ( whatever that is ) was available either. She said she was putting in for an emergency call back from a supervisor. I said they will call today, correct? The CD will renew tomorrow and the decision has to be made today. She said she making it urgent. I again said they will call today correct. She said I am hanging up to get someone right now. It is now 2 hours later and no phone call and they are closed. No call. Not surprised. USAA has gone downhill since their new CEO has taken over. We are XXXX XXXX XXXX and can not go thru having our credit dinged more than it already is getting dinged right now by the federal government and banks to help out in the shut down. We chose USAA because of the program that they described to us and we did what was asked of us. They should be following thru and doing their part now that the 2 years are up. We have seen them break federal and state laws when it comes to insurance and have moved our insurance from them and now we see they think they are above the law in banking also. We hope that you will help us to let them know they are not.

              "22873  This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that BANKAMERICA has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to mis-report. Moreconfirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request mustover, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct.

              "51741  I hired a contractor to install an epoxy floor in my basement. On XX/XX/XXXX, ( after being paid in full ) the contractor refused to finish the floor, honor the warranty, or provide compensation for the damages he caused to my bathtub and concrete patio. The payment to the merchant was split up into two separate transactions, so I disputed both charges with Citi on the same date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). My dispute numbers are XXXX and XXXX. Citi handled these disputes completely differently, and this dispute is regarding the way in which Citi has handled dispute # XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that they received the dispute XXXX, this email made no requests for information or even a detailed reason for my dispute. The next email I received came on XX/XX/XXXX. It said that they contacted the merchant and would let me know if they needed anything further. This is in stark contrast to the notice that was sent to my account on XX/XX/XXXX for the other dispute ( XXXX ) which requested a detailed account of the transaction as well as the reason for the dispute and documentation from an expert concerning what was wrong with the floor. I reached out to Citis dispute department via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I expressed my concern that I hadnt been asked to provide any information for the dispute in this complaint # XXXX. I was told that I could send the information via email and that it would be attached to my dispute. I sent all of the information that was requested for the other dispute in for the dispute in this complaint # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This information included statements from 4 different experts regarding the issues with the floor, a transcript of all the text communication between myself and the merchant ( including the text where he stated that he would not be honoring the warranty ), all email communication, the contract, warranty, terms and conditions, photos of the issues with the floor, and a detailed account of the reason for my dispute. All the information that I sent was the same that was sent for the other dispute, however on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my account stating that the investigation for the dispute in this complaint ( XXXX ) had been closed based on the information they had available. The notice stated that if I wanted to continue the dispute that I would need to return the signed letter as well as a review from a similar merchant saying what was done incorrectly and proof of what was expected vs. what was received. I contacted Citi dispute customer service again via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. The agent looked into the account and verified that all the required documentation was there. He told me that he would be making a note on my account so that the investigator would look back and find the information. He instructed me to send in the signed letter via email and write a note explaining that the information had already been sent. I called back in and spoke with another agent to verify that this was all that was needed, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in the signed letter with notations as instructed. I contacted Citi dispute center again on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure the letter was received and to verify that nothing further was needed and was told that everything was as it should be. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my account stating that my dispute had been reviewed and that they would not be able to assist because they did not have a letter from a similar merchant stating that the work performed by the original merchant was incorrectly or unnecessarily performed. I provided statements from 4 different similar merchants stating what was wrong with the floor and why it needed to be redone. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice in my account for the other dispute ( XXXX ) stating that they were continuing to try to obtain a permanent credit. Both disputes are for the same service and I have provided all of the same information. I do not believe the dispute in this complaint ( XXXX ) is being handled correctly. I have provided all the necessary and requested information in a timely fashion. The investigation into this dispute should have never been closed. The dispute # is XXXX  Credit card or prepaid card"
