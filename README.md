## Contents:

- [Text-Analysis-with-R.md](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Text-Analysis-with-R.md): Performing Text analysis and visualization in R

- [Text_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Text_Classification.ipynb): Text classification with sklearn and H2o to classify consumer complaints. H2o AutoMl is first applied to get understanding of best performing model. The selected model is further trained with sklearn for model improvement. 

- [Text_classification_Tensorflow.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Text_classification_Tensorflow.ipynb): Text classification (Tweet sentiment) with word embeddings using tensorflow. Applying pretrained word embeddings and using keras embedding layer for text classification. 

- [Text_classification_with_Bert.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Text_classification_with_Bert.ipynb): Performing Text classification with transfer learning and BERT using **Ktrain** library, which is a wrapper around **Transformer** library.

- [Text_classification_with_CNN.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Text_classification_with_CNN.ipynb): Text classification with Convolutional neural network (CNN) and tensorflow for tweet classification.

- [Text_classification_with_LSTM.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Text_classification_with_LSTM.ipynb): Applying LSTM network with tensorflow for text classification.

- [Topic_Modelling.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Topic_Modelling.ipynb): Performing Topic Modeling with Truncated SVD and Non negative Matrix Factorization on customer complaint data.

- [Transfer_Learning_NLP_TF_Hub.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Natural-language-Processing-NLP-/blob/master/Transfer_Learning_NLP_TF_Hub.ipynb): Applying transfer learning with multiple pretrained models for text classification using **Tensorflow Hub** and visulizing the reulsts with **Tensorflow Board**
